# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose 
The purpose of this module was to create an interactive map that displays earthquake data for the last 7 days.  

### Additional Map Features:
* Multiple layers
* Multiple views
* Earthquake data
* Major earthquake data
* Tectonic plates

### Tools used:
We used Leaflet to pull the map, Mapbox styles, Javascript and JSON to pull data from various sources.

## What I Would Have Liked to Have Done Differently
* I would have added a terrain view if the style was one of the available Mapbox styles.
* I was able to add a background box to the legend but it wasn't exactly as I wanted.  If I'd had more time, I would have adjusted.
